## Planned Epics

The first epic that our team is planning to complete is the Team Identification epic. The purpose of this epic is to let the user know the name of the team that built the application components that they are using. In order to complete this epic we are going to have to make a team name, then we are going to have to update our team identification (Team ## and name) in the browser tab/HTML Title and the application header and footer.

The second epic that we will complete is the About epic.  The purpose of this epic is to let our users know who we are, and to give them information about ourselves.  The team information includes our team image and missions statement.  We will also give the users information about each individual member on our team, including an image of each member, our names, and a short biography for each of us. 

## Metrics

These metrics reflect what was planned at the beginning of the sprint and what we actually completed by the end of the sprint.

## Review

#### Epics completed  
<p>t17 was able to complete both #42 About and #48 Team Identification epics. For the About epic we provided the user with information about the team and the people on the team by creating a team mission statement and an image, name, and short biography for each team member. Our team updated the team name in all the appropriate places to complete the Team Identification epic. The work was distributed throughout all team members</p>

#### Epics not completed 
<p> No epics were not completed</p>

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
<p> All team members got thier environment set up, whether it's locally or through ssh. Each member adapted quickly to VScode and using Git in conjunction. We have worked successfully as a team by using communication when we encounter issues, managing our time, helping other teamates when needed, allocating time to meet outside of class, and distributing the work in a fair and logical way so every tream member contributes via pull requests.</p>

#### Things that we need to improve
<p> t17 has gotten the basic workflow of using VScode and Git but we still need to be more consistent when executing pull requests, syncing with main, commit. There were times in the beginning of the sprint when we didn't fully understand the Git workflow and made some mistakes. We had some issues setting up our environments. Next sprint we need to go into it having our enviroments streamlined.</p>

#### One thing we will change next time
<p>Start sprint 2 with a better understanding of Git and VScode</p>
