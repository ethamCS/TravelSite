# User Experience - Team *T17* 

The report summarizes user experience testing performed on the team's application.

Each developer should ask the user to accomplish one or more simple tasks while monitoring their efforts.  
The user should attempt to complete the tasks without any aid from the developer.
Use a pseudonym to identify the user below. 
Set a time limit and tasks for the user to perform.

 
### Tasks

Each user should complete the following tasks in 10 minutes.
Developers should not guide the user, but the user may ask for help as a last resort.  
Consider this a failure when it happens.  

1. Find a place of your choosing (heliports, airports).
2. Go to your current location.
3. Load a File (provided).
4. Save a File.
5. Change Trip Name.
6. Go to any place in the itinerary of your choosing.
7. Pick a place from the random places.
8. Optimize the trip.

### Demographics

Age, nationality, and other background information can sometimes be helpful understanding the problems a user encountered.

| Pseudonym | Demographics |
| :--- | :--- |
| Christian's Mother | Interior Designer, 46 Years of age, not the best with technology |
| Evan's Mom | Human Resources, also not the most technologically literate |
| Emily, Ethan's Sister | Nurse and Pre-Med undergraduate, ok with technology |



### Observations

Note the users interactions with the system for each of the tasks.
Record the success, failures, and problems the user encountered for each task.
Note any aid that was given along with anything you notice from their use of the application.
Add issues to GitHub for any changes necessary to the system.

| Task | problem, aid, observation | hi/med/low | github#  |
| 5 | had trouble realizing that the tripname was click to edit, had to tell her to hover the mouse and pointed out that it was clickable. | med | N/A |
| 7 | had trouble realizing that random places was in the find menu, thougght it should be its own thing in the 3 dot menu. Once I pointed out that it was in the find she still had trouble finding the random places button becuase she could not tell that the icon was dice, she just thought it was the search button for out search even though it is progressive disclosure. Once I pointed out that it was in the find menu and the the icon was dice she had no issue. | med/high | N/A |
| 8 | trip was taking an extremely long time to optimize, this lead to her wondering if it was working. Also did not realize that you had to click the check mark to save the trip (this is not much of an issue she just is bad with technology, however the optimization is a big issue), she suggested a spinning mouse icon if possible while the trip is optimizing if it is going to take forever. | HIGH | N/A |
| 5 | It wasn't immediately apparent to Evan's mom that the trip name was clickable | med | N/A |
| 8 | The icon for optimize could be a little more obvious | low | #625 |
| - | The find button was hard to find. Emily didn't look through the hamburger menu at all. | high | TBD |
| - | When Emily was loading the file she didnt understand the purpose or the format. This is due to her not being the bes twith technology. She doesnt understand how the trips are structed in the file format. There could be a hoverable text over the hamburger to signify there are more features | low | TBD |
| - | When Emily was loading the file she didnt understand the purpose or the format. This is due to her not being the bes twith technology. She doesnt understand how the trips are structed in the file format. However, the load icon/button was clear and easy to use. | low | TBD |

| - | When optimizing a large trip it took a long time. Emily thought it was not working and prematuraly exited the optimization. We need to fix our implementation| high | TBD |
