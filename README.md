<h2> Team Preferences </h2> 
    <p>Our team memebers work preferences are extremely similar. Everyone is flexible about meeting times and using slack and or virtual communications such as discord to get together outside of class. We all have simialar goals to get A's in the class, we feel as though striving for an A and falling short would be better than trying to get a B orignally. Though, an A is the ultimate goal. Our group feels that communication will be key throughout the entirity of this semester. We feel very strongly about communication because we believe that as a group, we can solve problems much faster together rather than struggling alone as individuals. If we encounter conflicts between team members, we will work as a team to resolve them and find a middle ground. If we cannot reach a middle ground as a ground, we will meet with Dave.</p>
    
    <p> Our group understands that obstacles will without a doubt appear in every sprint. We feel as a team that when you are sturggling, unless it is a small issue, you should reach out to the group immediately for help in order to get a solution faster.</p>
