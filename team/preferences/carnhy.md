# Preferences for Christian Carnahan (Carnhy)

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Discord works best for me, I am always on my computer it seems, however I am happy to give my number to anyone on the team.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * So far from meeting everyone, I get the feeling that our team will accomplish just about any goal we set for outselves this semester.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are going to be learning how to take criticism better, also, I need to learn how to ask for help when I need it.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I don't feel there are any obstacles standing in the way of my team and personal goals, other than myself.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * This is a very interesting situation and one that hopefully I will not have to be apart of. However, if this situation does arise ,I believe the team needs to call a meeting a discuss why someone may feel that a B is acceptable instead of shooting for an A.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * In my opinion YES.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * This is a very hard question to answer right out of the gate, I think that it will likely take maybe 10 hours outside of the class a week to be successful, however I am just guessing and have no real gauge on how tough this will be.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I hope our team does not take the divide and conquer approach, however I feel that it would be beneficial at the beggining of the project to talk about what areas we are most comfortable working in.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * They will be marked down poorly in the peer evals. I also think Dave may have a chat with them.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This is okay, everyone has specific way of doing certain things. The members with different opinions need to talk about their opinions and find a middle ground.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will deal with different work habits by first learning the different habits and finding a way to structure my own around theirs to make work flow smoothly.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * YES.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Hopefully no more than twice a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Atleast one, but yes the whole team is preferable.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If the person is outvoted 4 to 1, I feel that the majority should have their way in this case.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk to Dave and ask for his advice on how to deal with the situation.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Same answer as above, talk to Dave and ask for his advice on how to handle this situation, maybe have Dave call a team meeting.
