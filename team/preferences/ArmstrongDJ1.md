# Preferences for Dylan - ArmstrongDJ1

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * texting, discord, or slack would work best for me.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Aside from our project, hopefully we can all walk out of this class with better communication and teamwork skills.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Try to be actively engaged in the conversation, and ask questions to make sure I'm on the same page.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I'm not very extroverted, so speaking up in a group discussion might be challenging for me.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Try to figure out some sort of compromise. I will happily go the extra mile especially if we have time to make our project better.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * We should all be putting in the same effort into the assignment, but if they want to put more work in then I think they should confirm with the group with what they plan on doing.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I don't have much experience with these types of projects so I really can't say.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Try to get them to do what they would prefer and fill in from there.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Check in with them to see what happened, if it was out of pure laziness then hold them accountable.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Talk it out and try to comprimise between the opinions.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * answer
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * To be determined. We have a discord which should make communication easier for us, and easy to meet. I'd currently guess maybe once or twice a week but that could change.
1. __Will you need the approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Yes. I want everyone to be happy with our project.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to find some sort of middle ground.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk to them, see if we could get them to ease off a little bit.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Attempt to reach out about it and try to break it down a bit further if possible.
