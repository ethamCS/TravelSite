# Preferences for Evan Ide (eide92)
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Discord or Slack are the best ways to reach me, but I don't mind texting either if it is easier for the group.  I'm free every afternoon, as well as the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we will work together effectively in order to complete our project to a standard that we are all happy with. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Most of my teamwork thus far has been 'divide and conquer', so I expect to develop skills that make actual collaborative efforts more effective.  I will probably have to communicate more openly than I'm used to, as well as get comfortable asking for help when I need it.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Everyone has different work standards that they want to meet, so we will have to decide upon an acceptable work standard for the group that everyone is comfortable with.  We will also have to communicate openly and effectively to be successful.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We will have to decide what standard is acceptable for the team.  If someone refuses to live up to that standard, we might have to involve Dave.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think that we should all strive to get an A.  Hopefully that means the same amount of work for everyone.  I don't see an issue with anyone trying to get the best grade possible.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I don't know enough about the scope of the project to answer this with confidence, but I suspect that an hour or two of work a day will be necessary.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, and assign tasks based on each of our strengths.  We should also try to ensure that nobody is forced to take on more than everyone else.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If it is a one time thing, we can hopefully try to pick up the slack.  If it becomes a habit, we will have to talk to the person who isn't following through.  If that isn't enough, we will have to talk to Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Hopefully we can come to an agreement about what constitues acceptable work.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Again, effective communication is the key to working in a team.  We need to understand everyone's work style in order to successfully assign tasks to each person.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think a standing meeting time outside of class would be a good idea.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * We will probably need to meet at least once a week outside of class, with the understanding that we can meet more often if needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Ideally we would all agree about each decision, but in certain situations that may not be possible.  No major decision should be made by one individual.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If we absolutely cannot come to a unanimous agreement, then we will have to go with the opinion of the majority.  Part of being a team is being flexible even when things don't go exactly how you want them to go.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I think one person being a leader can be natural in some cases, but it can be detrimental in others.  It becomes a problem if someone is acting alone without the support of the team.  In such a case, we will have to talk to the person about changing their behavior.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would talk to the team about dividing tasks in a productive way.
