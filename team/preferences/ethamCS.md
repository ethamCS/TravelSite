1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__
