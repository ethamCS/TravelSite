# Preferences for Farhan (gh: FarhanAxiq)

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * preferabbly via slack or e-mail, on discord is also fine too, I'm usually available from 12pm-445pm and 10pm-11pm daily (weekend incl.) *subject to changes*.
    Slack is also better for screen-sharing anyway.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectation is that we all get through this well and minimal conflict as possible, aside from that, maybe some experience that we all can benefit for real life or something.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * my goal is to communicate more effectively as those has been my weakest point and it's been very detrimental to my success.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I may screw up in the process and bringing down the rest of the teams (let's hope that doesn't happen). 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * maybe we should ask everyone to get an A, but if other really couldn't achieve A and can only settle for B, we can settle with those and make goal of getting A a bonus.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * it's best for the team to do them equally 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * as of now, can't really tell, just probably going to depend on the workload given.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * assigned a team leader once we all know who were qualified for, and assigned the team based on what they are comfortable working and their work habits.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * first of all, asked them why and asked them if they need help or something, but if that still doesn't work and they still doesn't follow through, the rest of us should bring it up to the meeting with the manager (in this case TA et al) and have some discussion.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * ask outside opinions or consultation (i.e: other group or TA) and see if it match any of us and then decide from there.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * either cope with it or create own (group) standard baseline of sort
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * yes, preferrably when everyone is available.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * if there's anything that warrant a meeting outside class, really, we'll see how that goes.
1. __Will you need the approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * yes
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * maybe ask them why they disagree and we'll accomodate those needs.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * ask them to back down a bit and listen to others as well.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * get some help to assist you and also maybe, take a break and clear the mind a little bit
